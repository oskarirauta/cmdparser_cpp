### cmdparser_cpp

C++ Command Line Parser

cmdparser is pretty simple and in some cases even limited commandline argument parser.
Example of usage is provided in main.cpp

### <sub>Note</sub>
Replaces older [cmdParser](https://github.com/oskarirauta/cmdParser) library which is now archived
because of library name unifying.

### <sub>Note #2</sub>
This library is deprecated and archived, it will no longer be developed - new library replacing
this is [usage_cpp](https://github.com/oskarirauta/usage_cpp)

### Depencies
none
